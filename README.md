This program is part of an online course (or YouTube video really) that I took
to learn more about .Net Core 3.1 and REST APIs.

Here is the link to the course: https://youtu.be/fmvcAzHpsk8

This REST API is a simple API that uses Entity Framework to perform CRUD operations
on a SQL database. The purpose of the API is to add programming commands to a database
for future retrieval.

I never thought I would be writing C# in VS Code, but I really enjoyed it!
I feel like I might have learned more because I can't just rely on the IDE to do
everything for me. ;)
